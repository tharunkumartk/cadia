# Cadia
Cadia is an on-chain arcade gaming platform on DeSo Blockchain that offers browser-based, plug-and-play arcade games with leadership boards. Compared to traditional web2 gaming platforms, we allow users to collect their in-game achievements not just as non-portable scores on leaderboards, but as NFTs that can be collected, owned, and monetized. Players can showcase their skills and engage with others through our in-game network, where they can collect leadership board achievements as NFTs, share gameplay strategies, and endorse other players with likes and follows.

Our first game is a poker strategy game called PokerGPT that allows you to play Texas Hold'em against ChatGPT.
